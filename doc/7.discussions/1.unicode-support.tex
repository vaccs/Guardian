\section{Unicode Support}
{
	Support for generating parsers that would
	handle Unicode characters and automatically
	converting to and from UTF-8 was originally in the
	specification for this program.
	At one time, this feature functioned, but it
	is no longer supported.
	The algorithms for operating on the regular expression
	state machines ran slower and were
	much more complex and difficult to maintain.
	The generated parsers consider each
	character as a byte, so if needed,
	Guardian can generate tokenizers that scan
	for UTF-8 strings while still internally representing them as a series
	of bytes. The effect would still be the same, the only noticeable loss
	between Guardian parsing multi-byte characters as strings rather than
	as Unicode characters is the lack of support in character sets
	for any codepoint higher than 255.
	Proper support for unicode support can be brought back in the
	future if needed.
