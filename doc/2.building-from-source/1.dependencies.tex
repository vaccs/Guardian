	Guardian needs several programs to be installed before it can be built.
	Guardian requires \texttt{gcc}, (GNU) \texttt{make}, \texttt{find},
	\texttt{sed}, the GMP library and \texttt{zebu}. If building on Ubuntu OS, all
	of the programs but the last can be installed with the command:
	
	\begin{lstlisting}
sudo apt install gcc make findutils sed make libgmp-dev
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	Zebu is a parser generator used to generate Guardian's parser. It can be
	built from source from its
	\href{https://github.com/ZanderThannhauser/zebu}{repository} without any
	additional dependencies. Running the command \texttt{make} will build zebu.
	\texttt{make install} will install zebu into \texttt{\${HOME}/bin},
	the installation path can be changed with
	\texttt{make install PREFIX=\${PREFIX}}. \texttt{zebu} needs to be installed
	into a directory listed in the \texttt{\${PATH}} environment variable.
	
	Zest is a testing framework used to verify Guardian. \texttt{zest} also must
	be built from source from its
	\href{https://github.com/ZanderThannhauser/zebu}{repository}.
	Complication and installation steps mirror Zebu. Once \texttt{zest} is
	installed, Guardian can be tested run with the script \texttt{./run-tests.sh}.
