	Guardian needs several programs to be installed before it can be built.
	Guardian requires GCC, (GNU) Make, \texttt{find},
	\texttt{sed}, the GMP library and Zebu. If building on the Ubuntu OS, all
	of the programs but the last can be installed with the command:
	
	\begin{lstlisting}
sudo apt install gcc make findutils sed make libgmp-dev
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	Zebu is a parser generator used to generate Guardian's parser. It can be
	built from source from its
	\href{https://github.com/ZanderThannhauser/zebu}{repository} without any
	additional dependencies. Running the command \texttt{make} will build zebu.
	\texttt{make install} will install zebu into \texttt{\$\{HOME\}/bin},
	the installation path can be changed with
	\texttt{make install PREFIX=\$\{PREFIX\}}. Zebu needs to be installed
	into a directory listed in the \texttt{\${PATH}} environment variable.
	
	Testing is optional, but if desired then Zest is needed. Zest is a testing
	framework used to verify Guardian. Zest also must
	be built from source from its
	\href{https://github.com/ZanderThannhauser/zest}{repository}.
	Complication and installation steps for Zest mirror Zebu. Once Zest is
	installed, Guardian can be tested run with the script \texttt{./run-tests.sh}.
