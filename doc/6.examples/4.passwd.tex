\section{passwd}
{
This example does preliminary checks on the \texttt{/etc/passwd} file.
The \texttt{/etc/passwd} file consists of one or more lines,
with colon-delimited fields: name, password, uid, gid, gecos, (home) directory,
and shell. There must be a user called ``root''.
All of the uid and gid must be integer values
and must be less than or equal to 65,535.
All home directories must be absolute and be a directory in the file system.
The root user must have its uid equal to 0.
For all users, their home directory \textit{should} be accessible to them, although
this is not required (warning not error).
For all users, the path to their shell must be absolute and must be executable
by said user.
