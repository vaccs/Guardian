\subsection{\texttt{isabspath!} Special Form}
{
	A call to the \texttt{isabspath!} special form is a kind of expression.
	The special form expects one string parameter and returns a true boolean
	value if the given string matches the form of an absolute path, false
	otherwise.
	Even if Guardian can determine the exact string value the form was
	called with, no substitution is done.
	
	\begin{itemize}
	{
		\item \texttt{isabspath!("/abc/dev/")}
		
			On a unix filesystem, the form would return true.
		
		\item \texttt{isabspath!("../abc/dev")}
		
			On a unix filesystem, the form would return false.
	}
	\end{itemize}
}
