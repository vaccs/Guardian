\subsection{Field-accessing Expression}
{
	Field-accesses are a kind of expression that can be used to access fields
	of a grammar value.
	The syntax for a field-access follows the
	form: \texttt{<object>.<fieldname>}.
	Depending on the structure of the grammar rule,
	some fields may not have a value. Accessing a field that does not
	have a value causes the checker to abort. To check whether a grammar value
	has a value for a field, use the
	\hyperref[subsec:possession]{\texttt{has} expression}.
