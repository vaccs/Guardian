\subsection{Bitwise-and Expression}
{
	Bitwise-and is a kind of expression that typically performs
	a bitwise-and operation on two given integer values.
	The expression can also be used to take the set-intersection of two given
	set values, resulting in a set of the elements that are
	common in \textbf{both}
	given sets.
	The expression can also be used to take the
	dictionary-intersection of two given
	\texttt{dict} values, resulting in a dictionary of all of the key-value
	associations that \textbf{both} of the given dictionaries had in common.
	
	If Guardian can determine the exact value of the two given subexpressions,
	Guardian will replace the call with the appropriate value literal.
	
	\begin{itemize}
	{
		\item \texttt{6 \& 3}
		
			Results in the integer value 2.
		
		\item \texttt{\{1, 2, 3\} \& \{5, 2, 4, 3\}}
		
			Results in the integer set value \{2, 3\}.
		
		\item \texttt{\{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3\} \& \{5: 4, 2: 5, 4: 6, 3: 7\}}
		
			Results in the integer-to-integer \texttt{dict} value \{2: 5, 3: 7\}.
	}
	\end{itemize}
