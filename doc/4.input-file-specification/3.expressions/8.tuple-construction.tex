\subsection{Tuple-Construction Expression}
{
	Tuple construction is a kind of expression and can be
	used to create and initialize new tuple values.
	The values for each field must be given has a parenthesis-enclosed
	series of comma-delimited
	subexpressions: \texttt{(<0th-field-value>, <1th-field-value>, ... <nth-field-value>)}
	To avoid confusion with a tuple of one value and normal parenthesis, the
	syntax for a tuple of one must include a comma: \texttt{(<value>, )}
	The syntax for an empty tuple value is \texttt{()}.
	
	\begin{itemize}
	{
		\item \texttt{()}
		
			An empty tuple
		
		\item \texttt{(1, true)}
		
			A tuple of the integer value 1, and the boolean value true.
		
		\item \texttt{(2.5, )}
		
			A tuple of the integer value 2.5
	}
	\end{itemize}
