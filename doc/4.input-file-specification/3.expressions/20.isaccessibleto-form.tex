\subsection{\texttt{isaccessibleto!} Special Form}
{
	A call to the \texttt{isaccessibleto!} special form
	can be used as an expression.
	The special form expects two string parameters and returns a true boolean
	value if the given path (the first parameter) is accessible (readable) to
	the given user (the second parameter), false
	otherwise.
	Even if Guardian can determine the exact string values the form was
	called with, no substitution is done.
