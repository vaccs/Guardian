\subsection{Bitwise-or Expression}
{
	Bitwise-or is a kind of expression that typically performs
	a bitwise-or operation on two given integer values.
	The expression can also be used to take the set-union
	of two given set values, resulting in a set of the
	elements that are contained in
	\textbf{either} one of the two given sets.
	The expression can also be used to take the
	dictionary-union of two given
	\texttt{dict} values, resulting in a dictionary of
	all of the key-value
	associations that \textbf{either} one of the two given
	dictionaries.
	
	If Guardian can determine the exact value of the two given subexpressions,
	Guardian will replace the call with the appropriate value literal.
	
	\begin{itemize}
	{
		\item[] \texttt{6 | 3}
		
			Results in the integer value 5.
		
		\item[] \texttt{\{1, 2, 3, 6\} | \{5, 2, 4, 3\}}
		
			Results in the integer set value \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}.
		
		\item[] \texttt{\{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 6: 8\} | \{5: 4, 2: 5, 4: 6, 3: 7\}}
		
			Results in the integer-to-integer \texttt{dict}
			value \texttt{\{1: 1, 2: 5, 3: 7, 4: 6, 6: 8\}}.
	}
	\end{itemize}
