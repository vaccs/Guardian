\subsection{\texttt{range!} Special Form}
{
	A call to the \texttt{range!} special form is a kind of expression.
	The special form expects one or two parameters, both integer values.
	The form results in a list of integer values up-to-but-not-including
	the last value, starting from the other value or 0 if called with only
	one value.
	If Guardian can determine the exact values a call to \texttt{range!}
	was made with, it will substitute the call with a list construction
	with the appropriate elements.
	
	\begin{itemize}
	{
		\item \texttt{range!(10)}
		
			Results in \texttt{[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]}.
		
		\item \texttt{range!(2, 6)}
		
			Results in \texttt{[2, 3, 4, 5]}.
			
		\item \texttt{range!(-3, 3)}
		
			Results in \texttt{[-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2]}.
	}
	\end{itemize}
