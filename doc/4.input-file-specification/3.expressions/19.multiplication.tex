\subsection{Multiplication, Division, and Remainder-divide Expressions}
{
	Multiplication, division and remainder-divide are kinds of
	expressions that only function on
	numerical values (integer or float values).
	Multiplication results in the product of the first number being multiplied
	by the second number.
	Division results in the quotient of the first number being divided by the
	second number.
	Remainder-division results in the remainder of the first number being
	divided by the second number.
	
	If Guardian can determine the exact value of the two given subexpressions,
	Guardian will replace the call with the appropriate value literal.
