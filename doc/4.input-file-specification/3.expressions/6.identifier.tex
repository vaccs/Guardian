\subsection{Identifier Expression}
{
	Identifiers can be used as an expression to refer to the value
	of a variable that has been defined previously. The rules for what series
	of alphanumeric letters would be identified as an identifier follow the
	rules of C. (lowercase or uppercase alphabetical letter, then zero or more
	lowercase or uppercase letter, any digit or underscore).
	
	For each named grammar rule, a global variable is automatically created
	that is assigned a list value consisting of all of the grammar values
	for that rule. If one sees an identifier expression and cannot find
	a variable declaration statement, check to see if it is a grammar rule name.
	
	If Guardian can determine the exact value a variable will
	have it will eliminate
	the variable and substitute all references with the value itself.
