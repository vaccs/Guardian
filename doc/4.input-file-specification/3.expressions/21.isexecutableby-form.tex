	A call to the \texttt{isexecutableby!} special form
	is a kind of expression.
	The special form expects two string parameters and returns a true boolean
	value if the given path (the first parameter) is executable by
	the given user (the second parameter), false
	otherwise.
	Even if Guardian can determine the exact string values the form was
	called with, no substitution is done.
