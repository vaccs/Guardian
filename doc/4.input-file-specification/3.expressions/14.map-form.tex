\subsection{\texttt{map!} Special Form}
{
	A call to the \texttt{map!} special form can be used as an expression.
	The special form expects a lambda value as its
	first parameter and expects the remaining parameters to be list values.
	This special form results in the list value consisting
	of all of the return values of the given lambda value called on all of the
	first elements from the given lists, second elements from the given
	lists, up to the length of the shortest list.
	\texttt{map!} requires at least one list and that
	the element type of each list is equal to the corresponding parameter type
	of the given lambda.
	If Guardian can determine the exact lambda values and lists all call to
	\texttt{map!}, Guardian will replace the call with a list
	construction with the appropriate elements.
	
	\begin{itemize}
	{
		\item \texttt{map!(\$int x -> int: x + 3, [1, 2, 3])}
		
			The result of this call to \texttt{map!} would be a list of
			integer elements 1, 2 and 3.
		
		\item \texttt{map!(\$bool x, y -> (bool, bool): (x, y), [true, false], [true, false])}
		
			The result of this call to \texttt{map!} would be list of
			(boolean, boolean) tuples: \texttt{[(true, true), (false, false)]}.
	}
	\end{itemize}
