\subsection{\texttt{crossmap!} Special Form}
{
	A call to the \texttt{crossmap!} special form is a kind of expression.
	The special form expects a lambda value as its
	first parameter and expects the remaining parameters to be list values.
	This special form results in the list value consisting
	of all of the return values of the given lambda value called on each of
	the combinations of elements from the given lists.
	\texttt{crossmap!} requires at least one list and that
	the element type of each list is equal to the corresponding parameter type
	of the given lambda.
	If Guardian can determine the exact lambda values and lists all call to
	\texttt{crossmap!}, Guardian will replace the call with a list
	construction with the appropriate elements.
	
	\begin{itemize}
	{
		\item \texttt{crossmap!(\$int x -> int: x + 3, [1, 2, 3])}
		
			The result of this call to \texttt{crossmap!} would be a list of
			integer elements 1, 2 and 3.
		
		\item \texttt{crossmap!(\$bool x, y -> (bool, bool): (x, y), [true, false], [true, false])}
		
			The result of this call to \texttt{crossmap!} would be list of
			(boolean, boolean)
			tuples: \texttt{[(true, true), (true, false), (false, true), (false, false)]}.
	}
	\end{itemize}
