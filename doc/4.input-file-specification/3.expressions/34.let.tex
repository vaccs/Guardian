\subsection{Let Expression}
{
	Use of the \texttt{let} keyword can be used as an expression.
	The let expression allows the creation and assignment
	of short-lived variables
	during the evaluation of another expression.
	The temporary variables are introduced into scope before the expressions
	that determine their value are evaluated.
	Any variables declared in the larger scope that use the same name as
	any temporary variable are unchanged, but will not be accessible during
	the evaluation of the let expression.
	The variables are assigned values in the order given.
	
	\begin{itemize}
	{
		\item[] \texttt{let x = 2, y = x + 3: x + y}
		
			Results the integer value 5.
		
		\item[] \texttt{let fib = \$int x -> int: x < 2 ? x : fib(x - 1) + fib(x - 2): fib(10)}
		
			Results in the integer value 55.
		
		\item[] \texttt{let a = 3, b = \$int x -> int: x + a: b(5)}
		
			Results in the integer value 8.
	}
	\end{itemize}
