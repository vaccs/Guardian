\subsection{Unary Operators}
{
	Unary operators '\texttt{-}', '\texttt{!}',
	and '\texttt{~}' can be used as expressions to
	numerically negate (requires a integer or float value),
	logically negate (requires a boolean value) and
	bitwise negate (requires an integer value).
	
	To complement the '\texttt{-}' operator, the '\texttt{+}' is also supported
	although only as syntatic decoration.
	
	If Guardian can determine the exact value of given subexpression,
	Guardian will replace the call with the appropriate value literal.
	
	\begin{itemize}
	{
		\item[] \texttt{-3 + 5}
		
			Results in the integer value 2.
		
		\item[] \texttt{!true}
		
			Results in the boolean value false.
		
		\item[] \texttt{!false}
		
			Results in the boolean value true.
		
		\item[] \texttt{\~{}2 + 4}
		
			Results in the integer value 0.
	}
	\end{itemize}
