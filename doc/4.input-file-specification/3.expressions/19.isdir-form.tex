\subsection{\texttt{isdir!} Special Form}
{
	A call to the \texttt{isdir!} special form can be used as an expression.
	The special form expects one string parameter and returns a true boolean
	value if the given path refers to a directory, false
	otherwise.
	Even if Guardian can determine the exact string value the form was
	called with, no substitution is done.
