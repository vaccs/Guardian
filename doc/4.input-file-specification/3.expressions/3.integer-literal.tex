\subsection{Integer Literal Expression}
{
	A C-style integer literal can be given as an expression.
	Base 8, 10, and 16 and their prefixes are supported.
	There is no theoretical limit as to the upper or lower bound of the value,
	as the internal representation Guardian and the checkers it generates
	use to store the value
	is the GMP's library's \texttt{mpz} datatype (an implementation of BigInts).
	
	\begin{itemize}
	{
		\item[\texttt{3}] The integer value 3.
		
		\item[\texttt{0127}] The integer value 87.
		
		\item[\texttt{0xDE}] The integer value 222.
	}
	\end{itemize}
}
