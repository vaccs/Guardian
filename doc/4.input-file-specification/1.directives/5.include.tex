\subsection{Include Directive}
{
	The include directive is used to tell Guardian to read the content of
	a file refered to by the given path for more directives and statements.
	The path is resolved
	relative to the directory containing the file currently being read.
	The directives and statements read from the included file will be considered
	to be declared before all of the remaining directives and statements after the
	include statements.
	A file may be included more than once, but it will be only read once.
	
	The syntax for a include directive is:
	\begin{lstlisting}[numbers = none, texcl = true, language = MAIA]
%include: "path/to/file.guard";
	\end{lstlisting}
}
