\subsection{Include Directive}
{
	The include directive supplies the path of a file that
	contains more directives and statements.
	The path is resolved
	relative to the directory containing the file currently being read.
	The included file's contents effectively
	replace the include directive in the including file.
	A file may be included more than once but it will be only read once.
	Guardian determines whether a given path refers to a file that has
	already been read is done by using the \texttt{stat} system
	call's \texttt{st\_dev} and \texttt{st\_ino} fields.
	
	The syntax for an include directive is:
	\begin{lstlisting}[numbers = none, texcl = true, language = MAIA]
%include: "path/to/file.guard";
	\end{lstlisting}
}
