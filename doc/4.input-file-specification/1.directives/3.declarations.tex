\subsection{Declaration Statement}
{
	Variable declaration statements are used to assign the result of an
	expression to a variable. Variables cannot change and are
	assigned a value once, and will retain
	that value until the end of execution.
	
	The syntax for a variable declaration statement is:
	\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none, texcl = true, language = MAIA]
<name> = <expression>;
	\end{lstlisting}
}
