\section{Directives and Statements}
{
	This section is for discussing all of the
	directives and statements that can
	exist at the root level of a Guardian input file.
	Statements are read by Guardian and translated into C
	for the generated checker to
	execute, while \textit{directives} are read by Guardian to be
	executed by Guardian itself
	and does not have any C code generated for them.
