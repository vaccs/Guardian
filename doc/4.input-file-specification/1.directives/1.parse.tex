\subsection{Parse Statement}
{
	The parse statement reads the content of
	the file referred to by a given path
	using the given grammar rule as the ``start" rule.
	The path can be given as either a
	string literal, an expression that results in a string, or the
	keyword \texttt{argv}.
	\texttt{argv} indicates that the parse statement should get the path from
	the next unused command-line argument that the checker program was invoked
	with.
	
	The syntax for a parse statement is:
	\begin{lstlisting}[numbers = none, texcl = true, language = MAIA]
%parse: "path/to/file" as <grammar-rule>;
%parse: <path-expression> as <grammar-rule>;
%parse: argv as <grammar-rule>;
	\end{lstlisting}
}
