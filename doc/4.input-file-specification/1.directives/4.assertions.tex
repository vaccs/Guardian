\subsection{Assertion Directive}
{
	Assertions checks that a given condition is true, and fails if it is not true.
	The condition must return a boolean type.
	Any assertion Guardian can prove has a condition that will always return
	true is silently removed.
	There are three levels of severity: note, warning and error.
	A failing error-level assertion causes the checker to abort execution.
	
	The syntax for an error, warning and note assertion statement is
	respectively:
	\begin{lstlisting}[texcl = true, language = MAIA]
%error: <expression>;
%warning: <expression>;
%note: <expression>;
	\end{lstlisting}
}
