\subsection{Assertion Statement}
{
	An assertion checks that a given
	condition is true and fails if it is not true.
	The condition must return a boolean type.
	Any assertion whose condition will always return
	true is silently ignored.
	There are three levels of severity: note, warning and error.
	A failing error-level assertion causes the checker to abort execution.
	
	The syntax for error, warning and note assertion statements is:
	\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none, texcl = true, language = MAIA]
%error: <expression>;
%warning: <expression>;
%note: <expression>;
	\end{lstlisting}
}
