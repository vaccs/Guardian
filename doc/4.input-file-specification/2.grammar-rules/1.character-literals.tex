\subsection{Character Literals}
{
	C-style character literals can be used in a grammar-rule pattern.
	Tab, newline, single-quote, double-quote and slash C-style character
	escapes are supported.
	The character describes the token (of length 1) that should be expected
	to be read at this point in the the grammar-rule pattern.
	This component of a grammar-rule pattern can be named and would appear to
	the programming language as a string containing the given character.
	
	An example of the syntax: \texttt{'a'} and \texttt{'\symbol{92}t'}
	and \texttt{'\symbol{92}n'}.
