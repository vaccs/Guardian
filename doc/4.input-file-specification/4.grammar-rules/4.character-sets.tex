\subsection{Character Sets}
{
	Character sets can be used in a grammar-rule pattern.
	The character set describes which characters could make up the
	token (of length 1) that should be
	expected
	to be read at this point in the the grammar-rule pattern.
	This component of a grammar-rule pattern can be named and would appear to
	the programming language as a string (of length 1) consisting of
	the character read from the file.
	
	The syntax of character sets is described in
	\hyperref[sec:charset]{its own section}.
