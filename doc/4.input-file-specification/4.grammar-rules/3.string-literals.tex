\subsection{String Literals}
{
	C-style string literals can be used in a grammar-rule pattern.
	Tab, newline, single-quote, double-quote and slash C-style string
	escapes are supported.
	The string describes the characters that make up the token that should be
	expected
	to be read at this point in the the grammar-rule pattern.
	This component of a grammar-rule pattern can be named and would appear to
	the programming language as the given string.
	
	An example of the syntax: \texttt{"abc"} and \texttt{"\symbol{92}t"} and \texttt{" "}.
