\subsection{Or Operator}
{
	The '\texttt{|}' operator can be used between two grammar-rule patterns
	to indicate that the file content at this point in the pattern can either
	follow the rules of one subpattern
	or the other.
	
	\begin{itemize}
	{
		\item[] \texttt{"a" | "b" | "c" | "d"}
		
			Either the token ``a", the token ``b", the token ``c"
			or the token "d".
			
		\item[] \texttt{"a"* | "b"+}
		
			Either zero or more a's
			or one or more b's.
	}
	\end{itemize}
}
