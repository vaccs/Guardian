\subsection{Integer Literal}
{
	Integer literals can be used in a grammar-rule pattern.
	The value of the integer cannot be higher than 255.
	The integer value describes the byte value that the token (of length 1)
	that should be expected to be read at this point in the the grammar-rule
	pattern.
	This component of a grammar-rule pattern can be named and would appear to
	the programming language as a string containing the given byte.
	
	An example of the syntax: \texttt{0} and \texttt{97} and \texttt{255}.
