\subsection{Print Statement}
{
	The print statement prints the result of the given expression to
	the terminal. They serve to help debug Guardian and/or checkers it
	generates. By default the checkers will skip printing unless explicitly
	told to do so with the "\texttt{-v}" command-line option.
	
	The syntax for a print statement is:
	\begin{lstlisting}[texcl = true, language = MAIA]
%print: <expression>;
	\end{lstlisting}
}
