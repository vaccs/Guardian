\section{Character Sets}
\label{sec:charset}
{
	Character sets represent a set of characters. There are
	256 possible characters.
	Character sets are used either in regular
	expressions or grammar rules.
	
	To improve readability and convenience of using Guardian, the user does not
	have to enumerate all of the characters they would want in their sets.
	Instead, Guardian can calculate the character set from the character-set
	\textit{expression}. This section discusses the supported operators and
	syntax for such expressions.
	
	These sections are listed in descending operator precedence. Parenthesis
	can be used to raise the precedence of character-set expressions.
