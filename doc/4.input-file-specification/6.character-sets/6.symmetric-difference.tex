\subsection{Symmetric Difference}
{
	The `\texttt{\^}' binary operator can be used to quickly take the
	symmetric difference between two character sets, each described through
	the left and right subexpressions. The symmetric difference of two sets is
	a set containing all the elements contained in \textbf{only} one of the
	two sets.
	
	\begin{itemize}
	{
		\item[] \lstinline[language=MAIA, columns=fixed]@'a'-'o' ^ 'm'-'z'@
		
			Set containing the letters of `a'-`m'
			and `o'-`z'.
		
		\item[] \lstinline[language=MAIA, columns=fixed]@'a'-'z' ^ 'e'@
		
			Set containing all lowercase letters
			of the English alphabet besides `e'.
	}
	\end{itemize}
