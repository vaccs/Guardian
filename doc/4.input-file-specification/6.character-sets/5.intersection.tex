\subsection{Intersection}
{
	The `\texttt{\&}' binary operator can be used to quickly take the
	intersection between two character sets, each described through
	the left and right subexpressions. The intersection of two sets is
	a set containing all the elements \textbf{both} sets have in common.
	
	The complement and intersection operator can be used together to calculate
	the difference of two character sets quickly. See second example.
	
	\begin{itemize}
	{
		\item \texttt{`a'-`o' \& `m'-`z'}
		
			Set containing `m', `n' and `o'.
		
		\item \texttt{`a'-`z' \& !{}`e'}
		
			Set containing all lowercase letters
			of the English alphabet besides `e'.
	}
	\end{itemize}
