\subsection{Union}
{
	The `\texttt{|}' or `\texttt{,}' binary operator can be used to
	quickly take the union between two character sets, each described through
	the left and right subexpressions. The union of two sets is
	a set containing all the elements contained in \textbf{either} one of the
	two sets.
	
	\begin{itemize}
	{
		\item \texttt{`a', `b', `c', `d'}
		
			The set of characters `a', `b', `c' and `d'.
		
		\item \texttt{`a'-`o' | `m'-`z'}
		
			Equalivent to \texttt{`a'-`z'}.
	}
	\end{itemize}
}
