{
	The `\texttt{-}' binary operator can be used to quickly represent the
	character set
	spanning all the characters between a high and low bound inclusive.
	The left subexpression gives the low bound, the right subexpression gives
	the high bound.
	
	\begin{itemize}
	{
		\item \texttt{`a' - `z'}
		
			All the lowercase letters english alphabet.
		
		\item \texttt{0 - 255}
		
			All possible characters.
		
		\item \texttt{0 - 127}
		
			All ASCII characters.
	}
	\end{itemize}
