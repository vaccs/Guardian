\subsection{Or Operator}
{
	The '\texttt{|}' operator can be used between two grammar-rule patterns
	to indicate that the file content at this point in the pattern can either
	follow the rules of one subpattern
	or the other.
	
	\begin{itemize}
	{
		\item[\texttt{"a"* | "b"+}] \textit{either} zero or more 'a's
			\textit{or} one or more 'b's.
	}
	\end{itemize}
}
