\subsection{Lambda Type}
{
	The lambda type is used to encapsulate a reference to
	a function as a value that can be passed in as a parameter, passed out as a
	return value, stored in lists and even called. (Think function pointers from C).
	
	The lambda type are specialized to the number of their
	parameters, their parameter's types, and their return type.
	The syntax for referring to a lambda type
	is: \texttt{\$<0th-parameter-type>, <1th-parameter-type>, ... <nth-parameter-type> -> <return-type>}.
	
	Special forms are not lambda values.
	
	Lists, tuples, sets and dictionaries all rely on their elements
	to support comparison, but lambdas and grammar types do not support
	comparison. Values of these types can be stored in these containers,
	but the container would lose support for comparison. Sets and
	dictionaries would not work outright because they rely on the ability
	to compare their elements/keys to maintain their internal data structures.
