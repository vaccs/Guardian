\subsection{Lambda}
{
	The \texttt{lambda} type is used to encapsulate a reference to
	a function as a value that can be passed in as a parameter, passed out as a
	return value, stored in lists and even called. (Think function pointers from C).
	
	The \texttt{lambda} type are specialized to the number of their their
	parameters, their parameter's types, and their return type.
	The syntax for referring to the type of a lambda
	is: \texttt{\$<0th-parameter-type>, <1th-parameter-type>, ... <nth-parameter-type> -> <return-type>}.
	
	Special forms are not lambda values.
	
	The \texttt{lambda} type cannot be used as elements of a set or
	as a key of \texttt{dict}. \texttt{lambda}s can be used in a 
	tuple, but the tuple
	would lose its support for comparison functions and therefore would
	also not be able to be an element of a set or a key of a \texttt{dict}.
