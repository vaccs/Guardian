\subsection{Grammar Type}
{
	The grammar type is used to store the values
	gathered when reading a grammar rule while processing a \texttt{\%parse}
	directive.
	
	Fields can be accessed with \texttt{<grammar-value>.<fieldname>} notation.
	Depending on the structure of the grammar-rule pattern, some fields
	may be optional. Use the \texttt{has} operator to determine if a field
	is present or not.
	
	A token can have the type of either string, integer, float or boolean.
	A field can either capture the first value of a token or all the values
	of a token by saving the values in a list.
	Fields can also capture the grammar values from references to other
	grammar rules. Like tokens, either the first value or an array of all
	of them.
	Grammar values do not support comparison.
