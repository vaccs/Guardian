\subsection{Boolean type}
{
	The \texttt{bool} type (short for boolean) is used to store boolean values.
	Boolean values can only be true or false, nothing else.
	The syntax for referring to a boolean type is: \texttt{bool}.
	
	The syntax for the two boolean values is \texttt{true} and
	\texttt{false}.
	
	\texttt{bool}s can be ored (\texttt{||}),
	anded (\texttt{\&\&}), and implied (\texttt{implies})
	on each
	other. Negation is also supported
	with the \texttt{!} operator.
	
	Equal-to, not-equal-to, greater-than, greater-than-equal-to,
	less-than, and less-than-equal-to comparisons can be done
	on boolean values with
	the \texttt{==}, \texttt{!=},
	\texttt{>}, \texttt{>=}, \texttt{<}, and \texttt{<=} respectively.
