\subsection{bool}
{
	The \texttt{bool} type (short for boolean) is used to store boolean values.
	Boolean values can only be true or false, nothing else.
	The syntax for referring to a \texttt{bool} type is: \texttt{bool}.
	
	The syntax for a true and false boolean value is \texttt{true} and
	\texttt{false} respectively.
	
	\texttt{bool}s can be or-ed ('\texttt{||}'),
	and-d ('\texttt{\&\&}') into each
	other. Negation and implication are also supported
	with the '\texttt{!}' and '\texttt{implies}' operator respectively.
	
	Equal-to, not-equal-to, greater-than, greater-than-equal-to,
	less-than, less-than-equal-to comparisons can be done on boolean values with
	the '\texttt{==}', '\texttt{!=}',
	'\texttt{>}', '\texttt{>=}', '\texttt{<}', '\texttt{<=}' respectively.
