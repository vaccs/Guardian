\subsection{Character-Set}
{
	Character sets can be used in a regular expression.
	When being used in a regular expression, a character set must be enclosed in
	`\texttt{[}' and `\texttt{]}' brackets.
	The syntax for character sets to Guardian is described in its
	\hyperref[sec:charset]{its own section}.
	A character set represents a set of strings where one character
	in the set corresponds to a string in the set consisting that character.
	
	\begin{itemize}
	{
		\item \texttt{[`a', `b', `c']}
		
			The set of the string ``a", string
			``b" and string "c".
		
		\item \texttt{[`a' - `z']}
		
			The set of ``a", ``b", ``c", ..., ``x", ``y", ``z".
	}
	\end{itemize}
