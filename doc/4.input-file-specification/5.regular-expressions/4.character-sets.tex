\subsection{Character-Set}
{
	Character sets can be used in a regular expression.
	When being used in a regular expression, a character set must be enclosed in
	\texttt{[} and \texttt{]} brackets.
	The syntax for character sets is described in its
	\hyperref[sec:charset]{its own section}.
	When a character set is used in a regular expression,
	it is interpreted as though any one of the characters could be read
	next.
	
	\begin{itemize}
	{
		\item[] \lstinline[language=MAIA, columns=fixed]@['a', 'b', 'c']@
		
			Equivalent to the regular expression \lstinline[language=MAIA, columns=fixed]@'a' | 'b' | 'c'@.
		
		\item[] \lstinline[language=MAIA, columns=fixed]@['a' - 'z']@
		
			Equivalent to the regular
			expression \lstinline[language=MAIA, columns=fixed]@'a' | 'b' | ... 'x' | 'y' | 'z'@.
	}
	\end{itemize}
