\subsection{Union Operator}
{
	The '\texttt{|}' operator can be used between two regular expressions to
	"union" their string sets.
	Unioning results in the set of strings made from all the strings in
	\textbf{either} the first or the second set.
	
	\begin{itemize}
	{
		\item \texttt{"a"* | "b"+}
			Either zero or more a's
			or one or more b's.
	}
	\end{itemize}
}
