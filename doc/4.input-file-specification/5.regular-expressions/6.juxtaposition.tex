\subsection{Juxtaposition}
{
	Juxtaposition can be used between two regular expressions to "concatenate"
	their string sets.
	Juxtaposition results in the set of strings made from concatenating all
	strings of the first set with all strings of the second set.
	
	\begin{itemize}
	{
		\item \texttt{"a" "b" "c"}
		
			The set containing the string "abc".
		
		\item \texttt{"a"* "b"+}
		
			The set containing all the strings made up
			of zero or more a's, then one or more b's.
	}
	\end{itemize}
}
